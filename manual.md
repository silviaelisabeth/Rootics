#### INTRO
Hej there, 

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) for electrochemical profiling in environmental monitoring. 
To speed up the often tedious and repetitive tasks of data analysis, I developed a graphical user interface to assist the user. 
This also allows for better reproducibility of the analysis.

You might have seen the project on my webpage: silviazieger.com

Depending on your operating system, I provide two different version - one optimized for windows and on eoptimized for macOS.

#### SOFTWARE FEATURES
Regarding the software features and requirements: 
REQUIREMENT     Software versions for both operating systems, macOS (version 13+) and Windows (version 11+), are made available here on GitHub.
                However, due to the size limitations on GitHub, I cannot upload the packed software. If you are anyways interested in the installation 
                file, please reach out via info@envipatable.com

FUNCTIONALITY   Support for management and automation of data analysis steps for electrochemical (micro-) sensors. The software enables multiple profile 
                data from different biological key parameters to be analyzed and visualized together, enabling direct comparison of results. Potential 
                parameters processed by the software are:
                  · Dissolved oxygen O2
                  · pH value
                  · Hydrogen sulfide H2S and/or total sulfide
                  · Electrochemical potential EP

EFFICIENCY      The software has been tested by researchers and compared to their usual analysis procedure. 

RELIABILITY     The main purpose of the software is to analyze multiple sensor profiles together and directly compare different key parameters. In this way,
                environmental mapping in a larger area or over a longer period becomes easier and more efficient.

USABILITY       The software is designed to guide the user through all necessary analysis steps. Accordingly, the user should understand the underlying 
                theory to decide whether the results can be considered reasonable or whether adjustments are required. However, no special knowledge is 
                required to operate the software itself.

MAINTAINABILITY In case of any bugs reported by the user, I will update the code scripts and provide an updated version on GitHub.
